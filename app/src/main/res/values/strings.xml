    <string name="no_ads_caption">"The Manifesto for 'No Ads' "</string>
    <string name="no_ads_h1">1. Multiplicated Content</string>
    <string name="no_ads_p1">Arguable, Internet did change the world and we all agree with that. But aggressive advertisement campaigns lead to myriad of sites specialized on content farming and applications created only for advertisement. Digital space became an immense advertising machine with poor quality and multiplicate content.</string>
    <string name="no_ads_h2">2. Old Media Days</string>
    <string name="no_ads_p2">Digital space started to resemble old days media. In fact is worse. At least there we are not forced to see the advertisement in continuum; there is 30 minutes pause.</string>
    <string name="no_ads_h3">3. Bad Quality Ads</string>
    <string name="no_ads_p3">And advertisement quality is critical. Most ads are not so appealing, some of them being downright ugly. And in most cases destroy beautifully crafted sites and applications and ruins user experience.</string>
    <string name="no_ads_h4">4. Ad Blindness</string>
    <string name="no_ads_p4">As a result users adapted and learned to avoid areas from screen covered by ads, the so called ad blindness. There are studies revealing that up to 93 % from ads remain unviewed. So little gain for business with so bad impact on user experience!</string>
    <string name="no_ads_h5">5. Ads are not Evil per se</string>
    <string name="no_ads_p5">That being said, we do not believe advertisement is evil per se. Au contraire. Good ads can help deciding and can be fun to watch. The only problem is we do not want to see ads all the time and want them separated by content.</string>
    <string name="no_ads_h6">6. Solution</string>
    <string name="no_ads_p6">The good news is it may be a solution. Create separated space dedicated for advertisement. This way user can enjoy content and when in need for new services or products, or maybe for some fun, can willingly access advertisement page.</string>

    <string name="accessibility_p3">The goal is to allow users with visual impairment to use the Atlas but is not limited to this. For example, accessibility mode can be used by a driver while he is on the road.</string>
