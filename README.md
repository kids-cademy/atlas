# kids (a)cademy Atlas

Atlas is a quick reference on a particular subject. This application is the core of a collection of applications named Atlas. Perhaps the name is pretentious or even misleading. Is not on purpose. We really did not found a better one.

Atlas is focused on facts, with reasonable text and media content. It is not meant to be exhaustive but rather to be used as a quick reference on a particular subject or field. For complete reference one can visit linked external sources.

Atlas is a community, open source project. Source code can be found on GitHub. Atlas articles are updated by contributors on kids (a)cademy site.

Atlas is distributed under Apache License 2.0, the same used by Android. This basically means anyone can do anything with application and sources but no warranty from kids (a)cademy.

Atlas is completely free. Free of annoying ads, no misleading in-app payment, no spy-ware. Development effort is donated. It is a humble way to show gratitude to Internet community that gives us all so much.
